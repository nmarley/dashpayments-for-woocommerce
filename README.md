# DashPayments for WooCommerce 

**UNSUPPORTED!**

Notice (2022-03-30): This plugin is many years old and no longer supported. Dependencies are outdated and probably have several vulnerabilities. **Use of this plugin as-is, is highly discouraged.** Also, I don't have the bandwidth or desire to work on this anymore. Please fork this and update if you want to use it, as it probably won't work in its current state.

DashPayments for WooCommerce is a Wordpress plugin that enables WooCommerce merchants to accept [Dash](https://www.dash.org "Dash - Digital Cash") directly, without the need for a third-party payment processor.

* Uses BIP32 extended public (xpub) keys for address generation.
* Requires access to an [Insight-API-Dash](https://github.com/udjinm6/insight-api-dash) instance

### Requirements:

* An Electrum-Dash wallet for receiving payments
* WordPress 4.4.2+
* WooCommerce 2.5.2+
* PHP 5.5+ with valid extensions:
  - gmp
  - bcmath
  - gd
  - mcrypt
  - openssl
  - curl
  - json

### Developers: Building the plugin

Install composer using your package manager, then use ```composer install``` to fetch all dependencies and place them into 'vendor/'.

If desired, use 'zip' to package the directory into a zip file with the same name:

    cd .. && zip -r dashpay-woocommerce.zip dashpay-woocommerce/

### Installation and Activation

Extract the .zip file and copy or FTP the dashpay-woocommerce directory to the WordPress 'plugins' directory. Activate the plugin in the WordPress-admin console.

Navigate to WooCommerce -> Settings -> Checkout. Click the 'Dash' option at the top of the page. Paste your xpub key from Electrum-Dash into the box labeled "Dash BIP32 Extended Public Key", and click 'Save changes' at the bottom of the page.

If you see a message stating "Dash payment gateway is operational", you should be ready to accept payment in Dash.

Here's a YouTube video demonstrating the exact process I described above:

### **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (READ THIS SECTION)**

It's highly recommended that you setup a cron job to handle background order processing. It's not technically required, but will catch things like if a user closes their browser before the payment gets processed.

For manual cron jobs, add this line to your crontab (replace <yourdomain.com> with your own WordPress site URL):

    * * * * * curl -s http://<yourdomain.com>/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron > /dev/null 2>&1

For CPANEL, run the command below every minute (replace <yourdomain.com> with your own WordPress site URL):

    curl -s http://<yourdomain.com>/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron > /dev/null 2>&1
